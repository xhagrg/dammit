This was just a stupid package I made to pass time when I was bored. In some context we use words such structured like "tHiS" or "ThIs" or any other variation. This package takes in a string may it be word or sentence and converts it into the format forementioned randomly. So EaCh TiMe You RuN tHe SCRIPT You Will Find A DiffERent VariAtIoN of ThE stRiNG.

How to use?
> It's simple. The following is the procedure.
  
  1. clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:xhagrg/dammit.git`
  2. `cd dammit`
  3. `python setup.py install dammit`
  4. Then in your command line open python command prompt
  5. `from dammit import Dammit`
  6. `Dammit.dammit(<your choice of word or sentence>)`

That is all. If you want to make the `dammit` process more efficient then just create a pull request. :) Good Day!
